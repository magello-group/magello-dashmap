# Magello Dashmap Backend

**NOTE**: This backend code was written very quickly to get as many features out there as possible, with little to no
knowledge of creating a Ktor-based project. The package structure is whatever I wanted it to be when I created the
classes, in other words: A lot of refactoring can most likely be made.

## Project structure

This is not a Spring project, so no magic injection is happening, just follow the application setup from `Application.kt`-file

## Suggestions of improvements

Except for a lot of refactoring, documentation and testing (who really needs tests? :smirk:) you could contribute by
checking the issues page.
